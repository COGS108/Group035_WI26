    "College athletes undergo demanding training and heavy competition schedules while simultaneously managing academic responsibilities. As a result, fatigue has emerged as a critical factor influencing athletic performance, recovery, and mental health. In sports such as volleyball, where matches are structured into sequential sets, fatigue may accumulate as competition progresses, potentially leading to declines in performance during later sets of a match. Prior research suggests that volleyball players that experience excessive physical and cognitive workload can reduce performance quality, including a decrease in visual perception, concentration, and reaction time <a id=\"cite_ref_1\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_1\">1</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to volleyball’s varying gameplay, examining fatigue can vary across positions because of the sport-specific demands. Players can engage in hitting, setting, defense, and blocking, which differ in their actions like jumping, lateral movement, reaction speed, and quick directional changes. Because of the specific position that players are in, their exhaustion can differ with the varying demands they have to meet. Previous research suggests that fatigue can be position-specific and can localize in different areas of the body <a id=\"cite_ref_2\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_2\">2</a></sup>. Hitters and blockers frequently jump in comparison to setters and defensive specialists, so differences in physical fatigue makes sense. Thus, it is important to consider how different positions need to recover during and after a strenuous game. Additionally, the change from pre-season preparation to in-season competition, then to the off-season, can impact an athlete’s recovery and performance <a id=\"cite_ref_3\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_3\">3</a></sup>. The shift from pre-season, where training is moderate and games are seldom, to in-season, where training increases and games are often, can also be a relevant factor to consider in a player's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing literature primarily focuses on physiological measures of fatigue or subjective survey-based assessments collected during training and competition. However, there is comparatively limited research examining how fatigue translates into measurable statistical performance changes during competitive play, particularly at the collegiate level. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address these gaps by analyzing how fatigue relates to in-game statistical performance across game sets and positions. By comparing early-set performance to late-set performance, we can provide quantitative insight into how cumulative intensity of playing-time affects gameplay outcomes. \n",

Furthermore, high-workload conditions will increase performance variance, shifting the population distribution toward the lower quartile of hitting efficiency compared to 1st-set baselines. This will demonstrate a consistency metric among players revealing how fatigue-resilent differs across gender and positonal categories."
