Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

This project uses pubicly available, aggregated sports perfomce data collected by professional leagues such as the NCAA and VNL. No direct interaction with human subjects occur and no private information is collected. Therefore, for this project and athletes informed consent is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    " A.2 Collection bias: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those? We are ware that performance data may reflect collection bias due to players having unequal playing time and possible differences in each position played. Therefore one mitigation strategy that may be employed is selectively looking at data per position before combining the data as a whole.\n",

    " A.4 Downstream bias mitigation: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)? This project is intended as an exploratory analysis of player performace statistics. It is not an evaluation of players overall ability, effort, or competence. Conclusions will be statiscal associations rather than judgments about player importance/quality.\n",
    "B. Data Storage\n",
    " \n",
    " B.1 Data security: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)? Data is public, so therefore this is not an issue for this project.\n",

    " B.3 Data retention plan: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed? Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project as the data is publicly available to anyone.\n",
    "C. Analysis\n",
    " \n",
    " C.1 Missing perspectives: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)? Quantitative performance metrics may not fully capture other factors such as coaching decisions, injuries, or even pyschological fatigue in players. These limitations will be acknowledged when interpreting results. In addition to acknowledging contextual factors such as injuries and coaching decisions, we recognize that our findings could influence how coaches interpret player fatgiue and game effiiency. For example, if higher cumulative workload is associated with reduced hitting effiency(e.g outside hitter), coaches may use this information to justify limiting playing time or subsituting certain players more often. Quantitative metrics alone may not capture strategic role differences, opponent defensive schemes, or set quality. We therefore acknowledge that statistical trends should not be interpreted without considering tactical context, match tempo, or the specific responsibilities of each position.\n",
    " \n",
    " C.2 Dataset bias: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)? Quantitative data is taken from a league in which all players are observed, therefore we believe their is little bias in these numbers. However, players with more playing time may dominate the statistics and over-represent in the performance categories. High workload positions such as outside hitter naturally accumulate more attempts and may therefore show larger efficiency fluctuations. Without contextual adjustment, these players could appear less efficient in late set moments, because due to the nature of the sport. Outside hitters carry a greater offensive burden. This creates a risk of role-based bias in intepretations. We may mitigate this by analyzing data within positions where appropriate and clearly stating that efficiency differences may reflect workload distribution rather than individual shortcomings.\n",
    " \n",
    " C.3 Honest representation: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data? Visualizations and summary statistics will be designed to accurately reflect the data without exaggeration. We will avoid misleading scales, cherry-picking results, or overstating statistical significance. Because findings could influence coaching and player dynamics, any association between workload and efficiency will be framed as statisical pattern. We will avoid ranking players in a way that could unfairly label them as \"clutch\" or inefficient. \n",
    " \n",
    " C.4 Privacy in analysis: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis? Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    " \n",
    " C.5 Auditability: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future? Future analysis will be based on future data provided by the selected volleyball leagues and will be reproducible.\n",
    "D. Modeling\n",
    " \n",
    " D.1 Proxy discrimination: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory? The model does not include variables that act as proxies for protected characteristics such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Only performance-related variables are used.\n",
    " \n",
    " D.2 Fairness across groups: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)? We will determine whether model performances is impacted across subgroups such as player positions. In addition to testing subgroup performance across positions, we recognize that model outputs could disproportionately affect players in high-volume roles. If the model predicts reduced efficiency under heavy workload, coaches might adjust substitutions in ways that affect athlete development, confidence, or long-term playing opportunities. We will therefore look at subgroup findings cautiously and avoid framing results in a way that disadvantages specific roles without contextual explanation.\n",
    " \n",
    " D.3 Metric selection: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics? Yes, our group has chosen metrics that we believe strongly relate to player fatigue, such as cumulative in-game actions and performance measures across sets. These metrics are appropriate for addressing our research question. We acknowledge that additional variables, such as player age or injury status, could further contextualize fatigue but are not included due to data availability and scope. This limitation will be noted when interpreting results. While our selected metrics focus on cumulative workload and performance efficiency, we acknowledge that optimizing for efficiency alone could unintentionally undervalue players whose roles require high-risk or high-volume actions. Outside Hitters may take more difficult swings against double blocks, which could lower raw efficiency metrics despite high tactical importance\n",
    " \n",
    " D.4 Explainability: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed? If modeling suggests that workload predicts performance decline, we must be able to clearly explain how variables such as cumulative attempts, set progression, and positional role contribute to that conclusion. Transparent explanation is important to prevent misinterpretation by coaches, analysts, and others who may otherwise oversimplify results and apply them in ways that could negatively affect athlete evaluation.\n",
    " \n",
    " D.5 Communicate limitations: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood? We will clearly communicate that our findings are based on observational player performance metrics and are intended to identify statistical patterns related to fatigue rather than establish causation. Limitations such as unobserved factors will be explicitly stated. Results will be framed as exploratory and contextual rather than definitive evaluations of player ability or performance. Because findings could influence real-world coaching strategies, roster decisions, or athlete workload management, we will explicitly communicate that results are observational and do not establish causation.\n",
    "E. Deployment\n",
    " \n",
    " E.1 Monitoring and evaluation: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift) Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    " \n",
    " E.2 Redress: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)? Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    " E.3 Roll back: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary? Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    " E.4 Unintended use: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed? We acknowledge that this project is exploratory and not formally deployed. Findings could be applied in ways that negatively impact athlete development, such as prematurely limiting playing time and labeling athletes as inefficient or not \"clutch\". Coaches could use these findings to change roster dynamics without remembering contextual analysis.We therefore emphasize that results should be used as supportive insights rather than definitive evaluations, and any practical application should incorporate coaching expertise, athlete communication, and broader sports science considerations.
