    "We aim to identify which social media behaviors are the strongest predictors of stress levels among Americans. Specifically, we will examine variables such as daily social media usage time, nighttime usage, number of platforms used, posting frequency, and passive versus active engagement, and evaluate their relationship with self-reported stress scores. We will analyze whether these relationships differ across age groups, including college-aged adults, young professionals, and older adults. Using multiple regression and tree-based machine learning models, we will determine which behaviors have the greatest explanatory power for stress and assess whether these variables can accurately classify individuals into high- and low-stress groups. This project will rely on publicly available lifestyle and mental health datasets to ensure that the analysis is data-driven and reproducible.\n"

    "Our group began our work with the premise that social media use has become a pervasive aspect of daily life for Americans across age groups. Its impact on mental health, particularly stress, is increasingly measurable in the era of digital engagement. Research investigating the relationship between social media behaviors and psychological outcomes, such as stress, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation, has expanded rapidly in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the proliferation of survey datasets and behavioral measures of social media use, researchers have sought to determine whether specific social media behaviors—including usage intensity, active versus passive engagement, and addiction-like patterns—are associated with stress levels and overall psychological distress. Prior work has largely focused on college students due to their high engagement with social media and elevated risk for stress, as well as the availability of validated survey instruments that allow standardized measurement of both social media behaviors and stress outcomes.<a href=\"#ref1\" id=\"note1b\">1</a> However, understanding these relationships across broader age groups, including young adults, middle-aged, and older adults, is critical for generalizing findings beyond the college population.\n",
    "\n",
    "One study by Cheng et al.<a href=\"#ref1\" id=\"note1b\">1</a> employed cross-sectional survey data to investigate the effects of problematic social media use on psychological distress among medical students. Regression analyses showed that frequent social media engagement was positively correlated with psychological distress, and maladaptive coping strategies mediated part of this relationship. This highlights the potential for specific social media behaviors to exacerbate stress rather than alleviate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study by Li et al.<a href=\"#ref2\" id=\"note2\">2</a> distinguished between passive and active social media use among 1,740 college students. Regression and mediation analyses indicated that passive use was positively correlated with social anxiety, whereas active engagement exhibited a negative correlation, mediated by communication capacity. These results suggest that not all social media behaviors are equally detrimental to psychological well-being, and that distinguishing between behavior types is critical for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longitudinal research by Smith et al.<a href=\"#ref3\" id=\"note3\">3</a> examined social media use before and during the COVID‑19 pandemic to understand its effects on stress and depressive symptoms. Survey data collected over multiple time points revealed that later stages of high social media engagement were associated with increased negative outcomes, underscoring the context-dependent nature of social media’s impact on stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional studies have applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand pathways linking social media addiction to psychological anxiety. Zhao et al.<a href=\"#ref4\" id=\"note4\">4</a> demonstrated that social media addiction directly increased anxiety and indirectly influenced it through reductions in self-efficacy and increases in negative coping strategies. Such analyses highlight the complexity of the relationship between social media behaviors and stress outcomes and suggest the importance of examining these pathways across diverse populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these studies suggest that while social media use contains meaningful information regarding stress, the predictive strength of specific behaviors is uneven and highly dependent on the type of engagement, measurement tools, and contextual factors. Building on this prior work, our project aims to quantitatively identify which social media behaviors—including usage intensity, passive versus active patterns, and addiction-like features—are the strongest predictors of stress among Americans across age groups. Unlike prior studies, we will employ both multiple regression and tree-based machine learning models to assess predictive strength and variable importance, allowing us to uncover behavioral patterns most closely linked to stress outcomes across the population.\n",

    "We hypothesize that certain social media behaviors, particularly higher daily usage, nighttime use, and passive engagement, will be positively associated with higher stress levels among Americans across age groups. This expectation is based on prior studies showing that frequent or maladaptive social media behaviors contribute to psychological distress, social anxiety, and emotional dysregulation (Cheng et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2025). Conversely, active and purposeful engagement is expected to have a weaker or potentially negative association with stress, indicating that the type of social media interaction plays a critical role in predicting stress outcomes. Additionally, we expect that the strength of these associations may vary by age group, with patterns observed among college-aged adults potentially differing from those in older populations."
