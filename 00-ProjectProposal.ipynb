    "College athletes undergo demanding training and heavy competition schedules while simultaneously managing academic responsibilities. As a result, fatigue has emerged as a critical factor influencing athletic performance, recovery, and mental health. In sports such as volleyball, where matches are structured into sequential sets, fatigue may accumulate as competition progresses, potentially leading to declines in performance during later sets of a match. Prior research suggests that volleyball players that experience excessive physical and cognitive workload can reduce performance quality, including a decrease in visual perception, concentration, and reaction time <a id=\"cite_ref_1\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_1\">1</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to volleyball’s varying gameplay, examining fatigue can vary across positions because of the sport-specific demands. Players can engage in hitting, setting, defense, and blocking, which differ in their actions like jumping, lateral movement, reaction speed, and quick directional changes. Because of the specific position that players are in, their exhaustion can differ with the varying demands they have to meet. Previous research suggests that fatigue can be position-specific and can localize in different areas of the body <a id=\"cite_ref_2\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_2\">2</a></sup>. Hitters and blockers frequently jump in comparison to setters and defensive specialists, so differences in physical fatigue makes sense. Thus, it is important to consider how different positions need to recover during and after a strenuous game. Additionally, the change from pre-season preparation to in-season competition, then to the off-season, can impact an athlete’s recovery and performance <a id=\"cite_ref_3\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_3\">3</a></sup>. The shift from pre-season, where training is moderate and games are seldom, to in-season, where training increases and games are often, can also be a relevant factor to consider in a player's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing literature primarily focuses on physiological measures of fatigue or subjective survey-based assessments collected during training and competition. However, there is comparatively limited research examining how fatigue translates into measurable statistical performance changes during competitive play, particularly at the collegiate level. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address these gaps by analyzing how fatigue relates to in-game statistical performance across game sets and positions. By comparing early-set performance to late-set performance, we can provide quantitative insight into how cumulative intensity of playing-time affects gameplay outcomes. \n",

    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",

    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
