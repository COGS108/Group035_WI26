    "College athletes undergo demanding training and heavy competition schedules while simultaneously managing academic responsibilities. As a result, fatigue has emerged as a critical factor influencing athletic performance, recovery, and mental health. In sports such as volleyball, where matches are structured into sequential sets, fatigue may accumulate as competition progresses, potentially leading to declines in performance during later sets of a match. Prior research suggests that volleyball players that experience excessive physical and cognitive workload can reduce performance quality, including a decrease in visual perception, concentration, and reaction time <a id=\"cite_ref_1\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_1\">1</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to volleyball’s varying gameplay, examining fatigue can vary across positions because of the sport-specific demands. Players can engage in hitting, setting, defense, and blocking, which differ in their actions like jumping, lateral movement, reaction speed, and quick directional changes. Because of the specific position that players are in, their exhaustion can differ with the varying demands they have to meet. Previous research suggests that fatigue can be position-specific and can localize in different areas of the body <a id=\"cite_ref_2\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_2\">2</a></sup>. Hitters and blockers frequently jump in comparison to setters and defensive specialists, so differences in physical fatigue makes sense. Thus, it is important to consider how different positions need to recover during and after a strenuous game. Additionally, the change from pre-season preparation to in-season competition, then to the off-season, can impact an athlete’s recovery and performance <a id=\"cite_ref_3\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note_3\">3</a></sup>. The shift from pre-season, where training is moderate and games are seldom, to in-season, where training increases and games are often, can also be a relevant factor to consider in a player's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Existing literature primarily focuses on physiological measures of fatigue or subjective survey-based assessments collected during training and competition. However, there is comparatively limited research examining how fatigue translates into measurable statistical performance changes during competitive play, particularly at the collegiate level. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address these gaps by analyzing how fatigue relates to in-game statistical performance across game sets and positions. By comparing early-set performance to late-set performance, we can provide quantitative insight into how cumulative intensity of playing-time affects gameplay outcomes. \n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "       This project uses pubicly available, aggregated sports perfomce data collected by professional leagues such as the NCAA and VNL. No direct interaction with human subjects occur and no private information is collected. Therefore, for this project and athletes informed consent is not applicable. \n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "       We are ware that performance data may reflect collection bias due to players having unequal playing time and possible differences in each position played. Therefore one mitigation strategy that may be employed is selectively looking at data per position before combining the data as a whole.\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "       Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "       This project is intended as an exploratory analysis of player performace statistics. It is not an evaluation of players overall ability, effort, or competence. Conclusions will be statiscal associations rather than judgments about player importance/quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "       Data is public, so therefore this is not an issue for this project.\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "        Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "       Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project as the data is publicly available to anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "       Quantitative performance metrics may not fully capture other factors such as coaching decisions, injuries, or even pyschological fatigue in players. These limitations will be acknowledged when interpreting results.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "       Quantitative data is taken from a league in which all players are observed, therefore we believe their is little bias in these numbers. However, players with more playiing time may dominate the statistics and over-represent in the performance categories.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "       Visualizations and summary statistics will be designed to accurately reflect the data without exaggeration. We will avoid misleading scales, cherry-picking results, or overstating statistical significance.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "       Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "       Future analysis will be based on future data provided by the selected volleyball leagues and will be reproducible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "       The model does not include variables that act as proxies for protected characteristics such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Only performance-related variables are used.\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "       We will dtermine whether model performances is impacted across subgroups such as player positions. \n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "       Yes, our group has chosen metrics that we believe strongly relate to player fatigue, such as cumulative in-game actions and performance measures across sets. These metrics are appropriate for addressing our research question. We acknowledge that additional variables, such as player age or injury status, could further contextualize fatigue but are not included due to data availability and scope. This limitation will be noted when interpreting results.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "       We will clearly communicate that our findings are based on observational player performance metrics and are intended to identify statistical patterns related to fatigue rather than establish causation. Limitations such as unobserved factors will be explicitly stated. Results will be framed as exploratory and contextual rather than definitive evaluations of player ability or performance.\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)\n",
    "       Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "       Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "       Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "       Our group believes that this item is not relevent for the project.\n"
